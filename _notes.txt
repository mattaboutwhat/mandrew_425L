UNSIGNED_ADDER
	. does it need an overflow out? is overflow
	  possible for an unsigned adder?

TWOS_COMP
	. doesn't have carry in
		. seems to use 'subc' instead?
	. carry through the full_adders doesnt seem
	  so work; c[0] in full_adder 1 isn't attached
	  to anything.

COMPARATOR
	. why not just call the subrtractor?
	  e.g. twos_comp() with the subtract bit set?
	. why does it even have an output, besides
	  the less_than, greater_than and equal_to flags?


GENERAL
	. COMBINE HARDWARE
	   . comparator uses a twos_comp subtractor; only
	     use one, and have comparator use that output.
	   . We don't need an enable at every 2x1 Mux; we 
	     should remove the enables from the lowest level
	     (ie the 2x1 mux) and implement it as a single
	     AND (or 16-bit AND module?) at the highest 
	     level possible.
